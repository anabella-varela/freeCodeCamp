# **Periodic Table Database**
This proyect had already a periodic table database. 
Some of the task were:
- Fix the database
There are some mistakes in the database that need to be fixed or changed. The queries I used for this task are in database_editing file. The periodic_table.sql file is a dump of the final version of the database.
- Create the script
Make a script that accepts an argument in the form of an atomic number, symbol, or name of an element and outputs some information about the given element. The element.sh file is the bash script I created.
