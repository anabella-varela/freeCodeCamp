####Create a number_guess database to hold the information suggested in the user stories. 

postgres=> CREATE DATABASE number_guess;
postgres=> \c number_guess 
You are now connected to database "number_guess" as user "freecodecamp".
number_guess=> CREATE TABLE users();
CREATE TABLE
number_guess=> CREATE TABLE games();
CREATE TABLE
number_guess=> \d
           List of relations

####For the bash file, complete the tasks below

#Create a number_guessing_game folder in the project folder for your program
mkdir number_guessing_game
#Create number_guess.sh in your number_guessing_game folder and give it executable permissions
cd number_guessing_game
touch number_guess.sh
#Your script should have a shebang at the top of the file that uses #!/bin/bash
echo -e '#!/bin/bash' > number_guess.sh 
#Turn the number_guessing_game folder into a git repository
git init
#Your script should randomly generate a number that users have to guess
$(shuf -i 1-1000 -n 1)
#When you run your script, you should prompt the user for a username with Enter your username:, and take a username as input. Your database should allow usernames that are 22 characters

#If that username has been used before, it should print Welcome back, <username>! You have played <games_played> games, and your best game took <best_game> guesses., with <username> being a users name from the database, <games_played> being the total number of games that user has played, and <best_game> being the fewest number of guesses it took that user to win the game

#If the username has not been used before, you should print Welcome, <username>! It looks like this is your first time here.

#The next line printed should be Guess the secret number between 1 and 1000: and input from the user should be read

#Until they guess the secret number, it should print It's lower than that, guess again: if the previous input was higher than the secret number, and It's higher than that, guess again: if the previous input was lower than the secret number. Asking for input each time until they input the secret number.

#If anything other than an integer is input as a guess, it should print That is not an integer, guess again:

#When the secret number is guessed, your script should print You guessed it in <number_of_guesses> tries. The secret number was <secret_number>. Nice job! and finish running

#The message for the first commit should be Initial commit

#The rest of the commit messages should start with fix:, feat:, refactor:, chore:, or test:

#You should finish your project while on the main branch, your working tree should be clean, and you should not have any uncommitted changes
